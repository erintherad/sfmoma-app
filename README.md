# SFMOMA Dashboard App

## ðŸŽ¨ Description

This interactive dashboard calls the SFMOMA API to retrieve and show various artwork and statistics from the museum's collection. The dashboard contains a series of graphs that call and return data based from the artwork and artists of the SFMOMA collection. It was created with minimal and clean material design. The site is also fully responsive for mobile viewing.

You can view a deployed version of this app [here](https://sfmoma-app.herokuapp.com/).
