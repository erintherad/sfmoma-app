# SFMOMA Artwork App

## Description

This interactive dashboard calls the SFMOMA API to retrieve and show various artwork and statistics from the museum's collection. The dashboard contains a series of graphs that call and return data based from the artwork and artists of the SFMOMA collection. It was created with minimal and clean material design. The site is also fully responsive for mobile viewing.

### Graphs

* The second graph showcases the artist gender breakdown from the collection.  Users can hover over each piece of the graph in order to see the specific breakdown.

* The third graph shows a percentage breakdown of the collected art based by country: United States vs Europe.
